libwapiti is a shared library that adds a thin api layer on top of
wapiti (http://wapiti.limsi.fr), a very nice sequence labeling tool
written by Thomas Lavergne.

The API currently handles: 

 * Creating wapiti models
 * Training the model on BIO-formatted sequences with regex features
 * Labeling BIO-formatted input strings
