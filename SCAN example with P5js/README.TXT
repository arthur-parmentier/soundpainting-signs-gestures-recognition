This is a simple solution for interfacing "patches" created in MaxMSP/Jitter 
(https://cycling74.com) and "sketches" written in P5*js (https://p5js.org). 

The solution uses the [jweb] object from MaxMSP to load P5*js sketch, and for 
bidirectional communication (messaging) between MaxMSP patch holding the [jweb] object 
and the loaded sketch.

Check example MaxMSP patch and P5*js sketch for detailed information.
