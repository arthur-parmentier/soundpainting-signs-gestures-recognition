                          Wapiti installation

If you have a recent compiler, normally you can just do the classical:
	make
	make install
switch to super user for the second. If you want to install somewhere else than
in /usr/local you will have to edit the variable definitions at the head of the
Makefile.

You can disable the non C99 compliant features by modifying the wapiti.h in the
src/ directory. This should allow you to compile Wapiti on almost any platform
who have a C99 compiler.
