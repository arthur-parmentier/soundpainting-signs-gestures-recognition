    Add space matching in regexp
    Fix a few small bugs

19/03/2011
  Release v1.1.3: Some small improvements

    New option --jobsize for fine grained multi threading
    Improved SGD index construction : a lot faster
    Fix a small bug in sparse multi-threaded gradient

12/11/2010
  Release v1.1.2: Bug fix release

    Fix a small bug in L-BFGS/OWL-QN, should improve a bit
      convergence speed in some case.
    Fix a bug in multi-thread job system thanks to Alexander Fraser,
      should fix error rates and training speed on large dataset.
    Fix two small memory leaks.
    Some improvment in quark database handling.

24/09/2010
  Release v1.1.1: Mainly multi-threading improvements

    RPROP algorithm is now fully multi-threaded.
    Error rate estimation during training is now multi-threaded.
    Better jobs scheduling in multi-threaded gradient.
    Multi-threading code can be disabled (compilation on Windows should
      be simpler).
    Fixed bug in L1 optimization with RPROP (should improve stability).

08/09/2010
  Release v1.1.0: A few new features

    Added maxent mode.
    Added decoding through posteriors, this should improve accuracy
      at the price of computational time.
    Added the RPROP optimization algorithm.
    Added absolute indexing in patterns.
    Changed the scored output format as the posterior decoding
      provide normalized score at each position. The output is now
      compatible with CRF++.
      Some code cleanup.

29/07/2010
