Soundpainting language recognition

Soundpainting is the universal multidisciplinary live composing sign language for musicians, actors, dancers, and visual Artists. 
The language comprises more than 1500 gestures that are signed by the Soundpainter (composer) to indicate the type of material desired of the performers. 
The creation of the composition is realized, by the Soundpainter, through the parameters of each set of signed gestures.

The goal of this project is to build a performance and pedagogical tool based on the soundpainting language. Using a machine-learning algorithm, the software will be able to recognize soundpainting signs
from motion-tracking equipment and let the user control it's virtual orchestra and discover the soundpainting language.
